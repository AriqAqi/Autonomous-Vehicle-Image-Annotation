# Autonomous-Vehicle-Image-Annotation
This project is a practical demonstration of how image data for autonomous vehicles is annotated using a professional labeling tool, [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/). The goal is to simulate real-world annotation pipelines used in the development of computer vision models for self-driving cars.
